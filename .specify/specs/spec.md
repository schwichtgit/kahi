# Feature Specification: Kahi

## Overview

**Project:** Kahi -- Lightweight process supervisor for modern infrastructure
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** Draft

### Summary

Kahi is a modern process supervisor for POSIX systems, written in Go. It manages long-running processes with automatic restart, health monitoring, structured logging, and a REST API. Designed as a container-first replacement for Python's supervisord, it ships as a single static binary with zero runtime dependencies.

### Scope

- Process lifecycle management (start, stop, restart, autorestart, backoff)
- TOML-based configuration with hot reload
- REST/JSON API with SSE streaming, Prometheus metrics, optional Web UI
- Event system with pub/sub, event listeners, and webhook notifications
- CLI control, health probes, structured logging
- supervisord.conf migration tool
- FastCGI process management

---

## Functional Features

### FUNC-001: Process State Machine

**Description:** Implement the process state machine with enforced state transitions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a process in STOPPED state
  **When** a start command is issued
  **Then** the process transitions to STARTING state

- **Given** a process in STARTING state
  **When** the process has been running for `startsecs` seconds
  **Then** the process transitions to RUNNING state

- **Given** a process in STARTING state
  **When** the process exits before `startsecs` seconds
  **Then** the process transitions to BACKOFF state

- **Given** a process in BACKOFF state with retries remaining
  **When** the backoff delay expires
  **Then** the process transitions to STARTING state

- **Given** a process in BACKOFF state with no retries remaining
  **When** the retry limit is reached
  **Then** the process transitions to FATAL state

- **Given** a process in RUNNING state
  **When** a stop command is issued
  **Then** the process transitions to STOPPING state

- **Given** a process in STOPPING state
  **When** the process exits
  **Then** the process transitions to STOPPED state

- **Given** a process in RUNNING state
  **When** the process exits on its own
  **Then** the process transitions to EXITED state

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invalid state transition attempted | Transition rejected, error logged | "cannot transition from {current} to {target}" |
| State query for unknown process | Return error | "no such process: {name}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Transition from STOPPING to EXITED must work even if stop signal was not the cause of exit
- BACKOFF retry counter resets when process successfully reaches RUNNING state
- Clock rollback during STARTING state must not cause premature transition to RUNNING

**Dependencies:** INFRA-001

---

### FUNC-002: Process Start

**Description:** Start a child process with proper isolation, pipe capture, and configurable environment inheritance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a valid process configuration
  **When** a start command is issued
  **Then** the child process is exec'd directly (no shell), stdout/stderr pipes are created, and the process gets its own process group via setpgid

- **Given** a process with `environment` config (default mode)
  **When** the process starts
  **Then** the child inherits all parent environment variables, plus SUPERVISOR_ENABLED=1, SUPERVISOR_PROCESS_NAME, SUPERVISOR_GROUP_NAME, and process-specific `environment` config overrides

- **Given** a process with `clean_environment = true`
  **When** the process starts
  **Then** only Kahi-set vars (SUPERVISOR_ENABLED, SUPERVISOR_PROCESS_NAME, SUPERVISOR_GROUP_NAME) and explicitly configured `environment` vars are present in the child environment (whitelist-only mode for sensitive environments)

- **Given** a process with `autostart = true` (default)
  **When** Kahi starts
  **Then** the process is started automatically

- **Given** a process with `autostart = false`
  **When** Kahi starts
  **Then** the process remains in STOPPED state until manually started

- **Given** a process with `directory` config
  **When** the process starts
  **Then** the child process working directory is set to the configured path

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Command binary not found | Process goes to FATAL, spawn error recorded | "spawn error: {command}: no such file" |
| Command not executable | Process goes to FATAL | "spawn error: {command}: permission denied" |
| Process already running | Reject start, return error | "process already started: {name}" |
| Directory does not exist | Process goes to FATAL | "spawn error: directory {path} does not exist" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Binary path is resolved via PATH lookup at exec time
- File descriptor inheritance is limited to stdin/stdout/stderr pipes only
- If pipe creation fails, process goes to FATAL with spawn error

**Dependencies:** FUNC-001, INFRA-006

---

### FUNC-003: Process Stop

**Description:** Stop a running process with configurable signal, wait period, and SIGKILL escalation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a process in RUNNING state with stopsignal=TERM and stopwaitsecs=10
  **When** a stop command is issued
  **Then** SIGTERM is sent, process transitions to STOPPING, and after 10 seconds without exit, SIGKILL is sent

- **Given** a process with stopasgroup=true
  **When** a stop command is issued
  **Then** the stop signal is sent to the process group (-pid) instead of just the process

- **Given** a process with killasgroup=true
  **When** SIGKILL escalation triggers
  **Then** SIGKILL is sent to the process group (-pid)

- **Given** a process in STOPPING state
  **When** the process exits before stopwaitsecs
  **Then** the process transitions to STOPPED without SIGKILL

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Process not running | Return error | "process not running: {name}" |
| Signal send fails (ESRCH) | Log warning, treat as exited | "process {name} already gone" |
| killasgroup=false with stopasgroup=true | Config validation error | "killasgroup cannot be false when stopasgroup is true" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Process that exits during the stop signal send (race condition) must not cause errors
- Multiple stop commands on the same process are idempotent (second is ignored)
- Stopwaitsecs=0 sends SIGKILL immediately after stop signal

**Dependencies:** FUNC-001, FUNC-002

---

### FUNC-004: Autorestart

**Description:** Automatically restart processes based on exit behavior.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a process with autorestart=true
  **When** the process exits with any exit code
  **Then** the process is restarted

- **Given** a process with autorestart=unexpected and exitcodes=[0]
  **When** the process exits with code 1
  **Then** the process is restarted

- **Given** a process with autorestart=unexpected and exitcodes=[0]
  **When** the process exits with code 0
  **Then** the process is NOT restarted (stays in EXITED state)

- **Given** a process with autorestart=false
  **When** the process exits
  **Then** the process is NOT restarted

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invalid autorestart value in config | Config validation error | "autorestart must be true, false, or unexpected" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Autorestart applies only after process has reached RUNNING state (not during STARTING/BACKOFF)
- Process manually stopped (via stop command) is never autorestarted regardless of setting
- Autorestart during shutdown is suppressed

**Dependencies:** FUNC-001, FUNC-002

---

### FUNC-005: Backoff with Retries

**Description:** Implement exponential backoff for processes that fail to start, with configurable retry limits.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a process with startsecs=1 and startretries=3
  **When** the process exits within 1 second (three times)
  **Then** backoff delays increase (1s, 2s, 4s) and after 3 failures the process goes to FATAL

- **Given** a process in BACKOFF state
  **When** the backoff delay expires
  **Then** the process is restarted (transitions to STARTING)

- **Given** a process that reaches RUNNING state
  **When** it subsequently fails
  **Then** the backoff counter is reset to 0

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| startretries=0 | Process goes directly to FATAL on first failed start | "entered FATAL state, too many start retries" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Backoff delay is capped at a maximum of 60 seconds
- System clock rollback during backoff delay does not cause negative waits

**Dependencies:** FUNC-001, FUNC-002

---

### FUNC-006: Process Reaping

**Description:** Reap child processes on SIGCHLD, collect exit status, and trigger state transitions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a managed child process exits
  **When** SIGCHLD is received
  **Then** waitpid collects the exit status and the process state machine is updated

- **Given** Kahi is running as PID 1 in a container
  **When** an orphaned process (not directly managed) exits
  **Then** Kahi reaps the zombie via waitpid(-1, WNOHANG)

- **Given** multiple children exit simultaneously
  **When** a single SIGCHLD is delivered
  **Then** all exited children are reaped (loop until ECHILD)

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| waitpid returns unexpected PID | Log warning, ignore | "reaped unknown pid {pid}" |
| waitpid returns ECHILD | Stop reaping loop | (internal, no user message) |

**Edge Cases:**

- SIGCHLD can be coalesced by the kernel; must drain all exited children per signal
- Orphaned grandchild processes are reaped when running as PID 1
- Exit status includes both normal exit codes and signal-killed status

**Dependencies:** FUNC-002

---

### FUNC-007: numprocs Instances

**Description:** Launch multiple instances of a process from a single definition using numprocs and template variables.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a program with numprocs=3 and process_name="worker-%(process_num)d"
  **When** the program starts
  **Then** three processes are created: worker-0, worker-1, worker-2

- **Given** numprocs=3 and numprocs_start=10
  **When** the program starts
  **Then** processes are: worker-10, worker-11, worker-12

- **Given** numprocs > 1
  **When** process_name does not contain %(process_num)
  **Then** config validation fails

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| numprocs < 1 | Config validation error | "numprocs must be >= 1" |
| Duplicate process names after template expansion | Config validation error | "duplicate process name: {name}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- numprocs=1 with no %(process_num) in process_name is valid (default behavior)
- Template variables: %(process_num)d, %(program_name)s, %(group_name)s, %(numprocs)d
- Individual instances can be started/stopped independently

**Dependencies:** FUNC-002

---

### FUNC-008: Priority-Based Ordering

**Description:** Start processes in ascending priority order and stop in descending priority order.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** processes with priorities 100, 200, 300
  **When** "start all" is issued
  **Then** processes start in order: 100, 200, 300

- **Given** processes with priorities 100, 200, 300
  **When** "stop all" is issued
  **Then** processes stop in order: 300, 200, 100

- **Given** processes with the same priority
  **When** ordered operations execute
  **Then** processes with equal priority start/stop in lexicographic order by name

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Priority outside 0-999 | Config validation error | "priority must be between 0 and 999" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Priority ordering applies to group-level operations as well
- Shutdown uses the same reverse-priority ordering

**Dependencies:** FUNC-002

---

### FUNC-009: Homogeneous Process Groups

**Description:** Each program definition implicitly creates a group with the same name containing all its instances.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a [programs.web] section with numprocs=2
  **When** config is loaded
  **Then** a group named "web" exists containing processes web-0 and web-1

- **Given** a group "web"
  **When** "kahi ctl start web:*" is issued
  **Then** all processes in the web group are started

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reference to nonexistent group | Return error | "no such group: {name}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- A program with numprocs=1 creates a group with a single process
- Group name collisions between programs are caught at config validation time

**Dependencies:** FUNC-007

---

### FUNC-010: Heterogeneous Process Groups

**Description:** Explicitly defined groups that combine processes from multiple program definitions under one name.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a [groups.services] section with programs=["web", "api"]
  **When** config is loaded
  **Then** a group "services" exists containing all processes from web and api programs

- **Given** a heterogeneous group
  **When** a group operation is issued (start/stop/restart)
  **Then** it applies to all member processes respecting priority ordering

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Group references nonexistent program | Config validation error | "group {name}: unknown program {prog}" |
| Program already in another explicit group | Config validation error | "program {prog} already in group {other}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- When a heterogeneous group exists, the implicit homogeneous groups for its member programs are suppressed
- Empty groups (no programs) are rejected at config validation

**Dependencies:** FUNC-009

---

### FUNC-011: Group Lifecycle Management

**Description:** Add and remove process groups at runtime via API/CLI.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a new program added to config and config reloaded
  **When** "kahi ctl update" is issued
  **Then** the new group is added and its autostart processes begin

- **Given** a group with all processes in STOPPED state
  **When** "kahi ctl remove {group}" is issued
  **Then** the group is removed from active management

- **Given** a group with running processes
  **When** "kahi ctl remove {group}" is issued
  **Then** the command fails with "group has running processes"

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add already-active group | Return error | "group already active: {name}" |
| Remove group with running processes | Return error | "group {name} has running processes, stop first" |
| Remove nonexistent group | Return error | "no such group: {name}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Removing a group does not delete its config; it just deactivates it
- Adding a group that was previously removed re-reads config for that group

**Dependencies:** FUNC-009, FUNC-010

---

### FUNC-012: TOML Variable Expansion

**Description:** Expand template variables in config values.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** config with `directory = "%(here)s/data"`
  **When** config is loaded from /etc/kahi/kahi.toml
  **Then** directory resolves to "/etc/kahi/data"

- **Given** config with `command = "${APP_BIN}/server"`
  **When** environment variable APP_BIN=/usr/local/bin
  **Then** command resolves to "/usr/local/bin/server"

- **Given** process config with `stdout_logfile = "/var/log/%(program_name)s-%(process_num)d.log"`
  **When** program is "web" with process_num=0
  **Then** path resolves to "/var/log/web-0.log"

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Undefined environment variable | Config error | "undefined environment variable: {name}" |
| Unknown template variable | Config error | "unknown variable: {name}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Recursive expansion is not supported (a variable cannot reference another variable)
- Literal `%` and `$` can be escaped as `%%` and `$$`
- Expansion happens at config load time, not at process start time

**Dependencies:** INFRA-005

---

### FUNC-013: Config Include System

**Description:** Include additional TOML config files via glob patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a main config with `include = ["conf.d/*.toml"]`
  **When** config is loaded
  **Then** all matching .toml files are parsed and merged, sorted alphabetically

- **Given** an include path with no matches
  **When** config is loaded
  **Then** a warning is logged but loading continues

- **Given** relative include paths
  **When** config is loaded
  **Then** paths are resolved relative to the directory containing the main config file

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Included file has syntax error | Config load fails | "error in {file}: {parse_error}" |
| Circular include | Config load fails | "circular include detected: {file}" |
| Include glob matches no files | Warning logged | "include pattern matched no files: {pattern}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Included files can define programs but not override [supervisor] settings
- Duplicate program names across included files are caught at validation
- Included files are re-read on config reload (SIGHUP)

**Dependencies:** INFRA-005, FUNC-012

---

### FUNC-014: Config Hot Reload

**Description:** Re-read config on SIGHUP, diff against running state, apply changes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a running Kahi instance
  **When** SIGHUP is received
  **Then** config is re-read, and a diff is computed showing added/changed/removed programs

- **Given** a new program in reloaded config
  **When** update is applied
  **Then** the new program group is added and autostart processes begin

- **Given** a removed program in reloaded config
  **When** update is applied
  **Then** the program's processes are stopped and the group is removed

- **Given** a changed program config
  **When** update is applied
  **Then** the program's processes are stopped, config is updated, and processes are restarted

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reloaded config has syntax error | Reload rejected, existing config retained | "config reload failed: {error}" |
| Reloaded config has validation error | Reload rejected | "config reload failed: {validation_error}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Programs not changed in the reload are untouched (processes keep running)
- Reload during shutdown is ignored
- Concurrent reload requests are serialized (second waits for first to complete)
- During config reload of a program, stop/start commands targeting that program are queued and executed after reload completes
- If reload is rejected due to validation error, any in-flight restart completes and previous config is retained

**Dependencies:** FUNC-012, FUNC-013, FUNC-011

---

### FUNC-015: Config File Search Paths

**Description:** Search predefined paths for config file when not explicitly specified.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** no `-c` flag
  **When** Kahi starts
  **Then** it searches in order: `./kahi.toml`, `/etc/kahi/kahi.toml`, `/etc/kahi.toml`

- **Given** a `-c /path/to/config.toml` flag
  **When** Kahi starts
  **Then** only the specified path is used

- **Given** no config found in any search path
  **When** Kahi starts
  **Then** it exits with error code 1

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No config file found | Exit with error | "no config file found (searched: ./kahi.toml, /etc/kahi/kahi.toml, /etc/kahi.toml)" |
| Config file not readable | Exit with error | "cannot read config: {path}: {error}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Symlinks to config files are followed
- Config file specified via KAHI_CONFIG environment variable takes precedence over search paths

**Dependencies:** INFRA-005

---

### FUNC-016: Default Config Generation

**Description:** Generate a sample kahi.toml with annotated defaults via `kahi init`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** `kahi init` is run
  **When** stdout is a terminal
  **Then** a complete, commented sample config is printed to stdout

- **Given** `kahi init --output /etc/kahi/kahi.toml`
  **When** the path is writable
  **Then** the sample config is written to the file

- **Given** the generated config
  **When** used to start Kahi
  **Then** it is valid and Kahi starts (though with no programs defined)

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output file already exists | Refuse to overwrite | "file already exists: {path} (use --force to overwrite)" |
| Output path not writable | Exit with error | "cannot write to {path}: {error}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Generated config includes all sections with their defaults commented out
- TOML comments explain each option

**Dependencies:** INFRA-005

---

### FUNC-017: Daemon Log

**Description:** Kahi daemon's own log output with configurable format, level, and optional file output.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** default config
  **When** Kahi starts
  **Then** daemon logs are written to stdout in JSON format

- **Given** `log_format = "text"` in config
  **When** Kahi starts
  **Then** daemon logs use human-readable text format

- **Given** `log_level = "debug"` in config
  **When** Kahi starts
  **Then** debug-level messages are included in output

- **Given** `logfile = "/var/log/kahi.log"` in config
  **When** Kahi starts
  **Then** daemon logs are written to the specified file (in addition to stdout if in foreground mode)

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Log file path not writable | Exit with error | "cannot open log file: {path}: {error}" |
| Invalid log level | Config validation error | "invalid log level: {level}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Log file is opened with append mode
- Log level change on config reload takes effect immediately

**Dependencies:** INFRA-006

---

### FUNC-018: Process Output Capture

**Description:** Capture child process stdout and stderr via pipes and route to configured destinations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** default config (no file logging)
  **When** a child process writes to stdout/stderr
  **Then** output is forwarded to Kahi stdout/stderr as JSON lines: `{"time":"<RFC3339>","process":"<name>","stream":"stdout","log":"<line>"}`

- **Given** `stdout_logfile = "/var/log/web-stdout.log"` in process config
  **When** the child writes to stdout
  **Then** output is written to the specified file

- **Given** `redirect_stderr = true` in process config
  **When** the child writes to stderr
  **Then** stderr output is merged into the stdout stream

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Log file path not writable | Process goes to FATAL | "cannot open log file for {name}: {error}" |
| Pipe read error | Log warning, close pipe | "pipe read error for {name}: {error}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Output is line-buffered when forwarding to container stdout
- Large output bursts (>64KB/s) must not block the child process (non-blocking pipe reads)
- Pipe is closed on process exit; remaining buffered data is flushed

**Dependencies:** FUNC-002, INFRA-006

---

### FUNC-019: Log Rotation

**Description:** Rotate process log files based on file size.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** `stdout_logfile_maxbytes = "50MB"` and `stdout_logfile_backups = 10`
  **When** the log file exceeds 50MB
  **Then** the file is rotated: current becomes .1, .1 becomes .2, etc., up to .10

- **Given** `stdout_logfile_backups = 0`
  **When** the log file exceeds maxbytes
  **Then** the file is truncated (no rotation, no backups)

- **Given** `stdout_logfile_maxbytes = 0`
  **When** the process writes output
  **Then** the log file grows without bound (rotation disabled)

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rotation rename fails | Log error, continue writing to current file | "log rotation failed for {name}: {error}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Rotation is atomic (rename, not copy+truncate)
- Rotation check happens before each write; if adding this write would exceed threshold, rotate first then write
- If a single write is larger than maxbytes, the write is allowed (do not split writes); rotation happens on the next write
- Backup file numbering: `.1` -> `.2`, `.2` -> `.3`, etc.; `.N` where N > backup_count is deleted
- Byte size parsing supports: B, KB, MB, GB suffixes

**Dependencies:** FUNC-018

---

### FUNC-020: Syslog Forwarding

**Description:** Optionally forward process stdout/stderr to syslog.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** `stdout_syslog = true` in process config
  **When** the child writes to stdout
  **Then** each line is sent to syslog with process name as tag

- **Given** syslog forwarding enabled
  **When** output contains multi-line messages
  **Then** each line is sent as a separate syslog message

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |

  **When** the child outputs ANSI sequences
  **Then** sequences are preserved in log output

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | N/A | N/A |

**Edge Cases:**

- Stripping handles all CSI sequences (colors, cursor movement, etc.)
- Partial escape sequences at buffer boundaries are handled correctly

**Dependencies:** FUNC-018

### FUNC-022: Log Reopen on SIGUSR2

**Description:** Reopen all log files on SIGUSR2 for external log rotation tools.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** Kahi is writing to log files
  **When** SIGUSR2 is received
  **Then** all log file handles are closed and reopened (to pick up rotated files)

- **Given** syslog is configured
  **When** SIGUSR2 is received
  **Then** syslog connections are not affected (only file handles)

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| File cannot be reopened | Log error, continue without that file | "cannot reopen log file: {path}: {error}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Log reopen is safe to call concurrently with log writes
- SIGUSR2 during shutdown is ignored

**Dependencies:** FUNC-018

---

### FUNC-023: Log Cleanup on Startup

**Description:** Remove stale auto-generated child log files from previous runs on startup.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** `socket_chmod = "0770"` in config
  **When** the socket is created
  **Then** the socket file has permissions 0770

- **Given** the socket file already exists from a previous crashed run
  **When** Kahi starts
  **Then** the stale socket file is removed and a new one is created

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cannot create socket (permission denied) | Exit with error | "cannot create socket: {path}: {error}" |
| Socket path too long (>108 chars) | Exit with error | "socket path too long: {path}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Socket is cleaned up on graceful shutdown

| --- | --- | --- |
| Process not found | 404 before stream starts | `{"error": "no such process: web"}` |
| Process not logging to file | 404 | `{"error": "no log file configured for web"}` |

**Edge Cases:**

- SSE includes `X-Accel-Buffering: no` header for nginx reverse proxy compatibility
- Reconnection: SSE `id` field uses byte offset for log streams, allowing resume
- If requested byte offset exceeds current file size (e.g., after log rotation), resume from start of current file
- If `Last-Event-ID` header is absent, start from end-of-file minus configured tail bytes
- If offset is invalid (non-numeric), return HTTP 400 with `{"error": "invalid resume position: {offset}"}`
- Multiple clients can stream the same log simultaneously
- When no log file is configured, SSE streams from the in-memory ring buffer (FUNC-082)

  **Then** 503 is returned with `{"status": "shutting_down"}`

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None specific | N/A | N/A |

**Edge Cases:**

- /healthz does not require authentication (it's a probe endpoint)

- **Given** `GET /readyz?process=web,api` is requested
  **When** web is RUNNING and api is RUNNING
  **Then** 200 OK is returned

- **Given** `GET /readyz?process=web,api` is requested
  **When** web is RUNNING and api is STOPPED
  **Then** 503 is returned with `{"status": "not_ready", "failing": ["api"]}`

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unknown process in ?process= filter | 400 | `{"error": "unknown process: foo"}` |

**Edge Cases:**

- /readyz does not require authentication
- A process is "ready" if in RUNNING state; FATAL counts as "stabilized" but not healthy
- STOPPED and EXITED processes are not ready
- If `?process=` list is empty or missing, check all autostart processes

  **Then** stderr log is tailed

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No log file configured | Error message | "no log file configured for {name}" |
| Process does not exist | Error message | "no such process: {name}" |

**Edge Cases:**

### FUNC-049: Event Bus (Pub/Sub)

**Description:** Internal publish-subscribe system for event distribution. The event bus is core infrastructure, always active with zero overhead when no subscribers exist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a subscriber registered for PROCESS_STATE_RUNNING events
  **When** a process transitions to RUNNING
  **Then** the subscriber callback receives the event

- **Given** multiple subscribers for the same event type
  **When** the event fires
  **Then** all subscribers are notified

  **When** subsequent events fire
  **Then** the unsubscribed callback is not called

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Subscriber callback panics | Panic recovered, logged as error, other subscribers still notified | "event subscriber panic: {error}" |

**Edge Cases:**

### FUNC-055: Event Listener Pools

**Description:** Managed processes that subscribe to events via a stdin/stdout protocol.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** an event listener configured with `events = ["PROCESS_STATE_EXITED"]` and `buffer_size = 10`
  **When** a process exits
  **Then** the event is queued in the listener's buffer and dispatched when the listener is READY

- **Given** an event listener writes "READY\n" to stdout
  **When** an event is in the buffer
  **Then** the event envelope (headers + payload) is written to the listener's stdin

- **Given** the listener responds with "RESULT 2\nOK"
  **When** processing completes
  **Then** the event is acknowledged and the listener returns to READY state

- **Given** the listener responds with "RESULT 4\nFAIL"
  **When** processing completes
  **Then** the event is re-queued for retry

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Listener crashes | Restart per autorestart policy | "event listener {name} exited unexpectedly" |
| Buffer overflow | Oldest queued (not in-flight) event dropped, logged at WARN level | "event buffer overflow for {name}, dropping oldest event" |
| Invalid result format | Log error, re-queue event | "invalid result from listener {name}: {data}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Multiple listener instances in a pool; events dispatched round-robin to READY listeners
- Listener pool with numprocs=3 has 3 listener processes
- Event envelope format: `ver:3.0 server:kahi serial:{n} pool:{pool} poolserial:{n} eventname:{type} len:{n}\n{payload}`
- Listener response format: `RESULT {len}\n{payload}` where len is byte length of payload; payload "OK" = success, "FAIL" = re-queue
- If response parsing fails or payload is unrecognized, log error and re-queue event for retry
- Buffer overflow dropped events are counted via `kahi_event_buffer_drops_total{pool=listener_name}` metric

**Dependencies:** FUNC-049, FUNC-050, FUNC-002

  **When** an event fires
  **Then** the POST body is formatted as a Slack incoming webhook payload

- **Given** a webhook with `template = "generic"`
  **When** an event fires
  **Then** the POST body is a standard JSON object with event type, process name, timestamp, details

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Webhook POST fails (timeout/5xx) | Retry up to max_retries (default: 3) with exponential backoff: `delay = min(1s * 2^attempt, 60s)` + random jitter of +/-10% | "webhook delivery failed for {url}: {error}, retrying" |
| All retries exhausted | Log error, move on | "webhook delivery failed permanently for {url}" |
| Webhook URL unreachable | Circuit breaker opens after 5 consecutive failures | "webhook circuit breaker open for {url}" |
| Circuit breaker open | Attempt one probe request every 5 minutes; if probe succeeds, reset failure counter and close breaker | "webhook circuit breaker closed for {url}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Webhook delivery is async and never blocks the main supervision loop
- Webhook timeout default is 5 seconds
- Multiple webhooks can subscribe to the same event
- Webhook failures do not affect process management
- Circuit breaker state transitions logged at INFO level
- Expose `kahi_webhook_circuit_breaker{url,status=open|closed}` gauge metric

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unknown template name | Config validation error | "unknown webhook template: {name}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Templates support variable substitution from event data
- Custom template support (Go template string in config) is a future enhancement, not in v1

**Dependencies:** FUNC-056

  **When** config is validated
  **Then** plain HTTP URL is accepted with a warning logged

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invalid URL format | Config validation error | "invalid webhook URL: {url}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- localhost/127.0.0.1 URLs are exempt from the TLS requirement (for local development)
- TLS certificate verification uses the system trust store

**Dependencies:** FUNC-056

---

  **Then** it handles signals, reaps zombies, and manages processes

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | N/A | N/A |

**Edge Cases:**

- Ctrl+C in foreground mode triggers graceful shutdown
- Foreground mode is the default; no flag needed to enable it

- **Given** daemonize mode
  **When** PID file path is configured
  **Then** PID file contains the daemon PID

- **Given** daemonize mode on exit
  **When** daemon stops
  **Then** PID file is removed

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PID file path not writable | Exit with error | "cannot write PID file: {path}: {error}" |

### FUNC-065: PID 1 Zombie Reaping

**Description:** When running as PID 1, reap all orphaned child processes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** Kahi is PID 1
  **When** any process on the system becomes an orphan
  **Then** Kahi reaps it via waitpid(-1, WNOHANG) in the main loop

- **Given** Kahi is NOT PID 1
  **When** orphaned processes appear
  **Then** the OS init system handles them (Kahi only reaps its own children)

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | N/A | N/A |

**Edge Cases:**

- PID 1 detection at startup: `os.Getpid() == 1`

  **When** shutdown completes
  **Then** Kahi exits with code 0

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Process stuck (doesn't respond to SIGKILL) | Log error, exit anyway after timeout | "process {name} stuck, giving up" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Shutdown timeout is configurable (default: 30 seconds total); clock starts after SIGTERM is sent to all processes
- Per-process stopwaitsecs is respected if it fits within the remaining global timeout
- If total shutdown timeout expires, all remaining processes receive SIGKILL immediately
- Processes in STARTING state transition to STOPPED immediately on shutdown (no stopwaitsecs wait)
- If a process ignores SIGKILL after 5 seconds, log error and exit anyway

**Dependencies:** FUNC-003, FUNC-008

  **When** Kahi starts and current NPROC < 512
  **Then** Kahi attempts to raise RLIMIT_NPROC to 512

- **Given** rlimit raise fails (permission denied)
  **When** Kahi starts
  **Then** Kahi exits with error

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cannot raise rlimit | Exit with error | "cannot set NOFILE to {n}: {error} (current soft={s}, hard={h})" |

**Edge Cases:**

  **When** web has stdin enabled
  **Then** "quit\n" is written to stdin

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Process not running | Return error | "process not running: {name}" |
| Process has no stdin | Return error | "process {name} does not accept stdin" |
| Stdin pipe broken | Return error | "stdin pipe broken for {name}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- stdin is optional per-process (default: no stdin pipe)
- Data must include explicit newlines if needed

**Dependencies:** FUNC-026, FUNC-002

### FUNC-078: Web UI Status Page

**Description:** HTML page showing all processes with state, PID, uptime, and action buttons.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** Web UI is enabled
  **When** `GET /` is requested in a browser
  **Then** an HTML page lists all processes with: name, group, state (color-coded), PID, uptime, description, and action buttons (Start, Stop, Restart, Clear Log, Tail Stdout, Tail Stderr)

- **Given** the status page
  **When** "Stop All" or "Restart All" button is clicked
  **Then** the corresponding API action is triggered

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API call fails from UI | Display error notification | "Failed to {action} {name}: {error}" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Page auto-refreshes status every 5 seconds via JavaScript
- Works without JavaScript (static HTML with forms as fallback)
- Responsive layout for mobile viewing

**Dependencies:** FUNC-026

---

### FUNC-079: Web UI Log Viewer

**Description:** Browser-based log tailing for process stdout/stderr.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** Web UI is enabled and "Tail Stdout" is clicked for process "web"
  **When** the log viewer page loads
  **Then** real-time stdout output is streamed to the browser via SSE

- **Given** the log viewer
  **When** the user selects stderr
  **Then** stderr is streamed instead

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No log file configured | Display message | "No log file configured for this process" |
| SSE connection drops | Auto-reconnect | (reconnects silently) |

**Edge Cases:**

- Log viewer shows last 100 lines on initial load, then streams new lines
- ANSI escape codes are rendered as colors in the browser
- Auto-scroll to bottom with manual scroll override

**Dependencies:** FUNC-027, FUNC-078

---

### FUNC-080: Web UI Embedded Assets

**Description:** Serve Web UI as Go-embedded static files for zero-dependency deployment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** Web UI is enabled
  **When** the binary is deployed with no additional files
  **Then** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are served from embedded assets via `go:embed`

- **Given** `[server.web] static_dir = "/opt/kahi/web"` in config
  **When** the directory exists
  **Then** files from the directory override embedded assets (for customization)

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Custom static_dir not found | Fall back to embedded assets with warning | "static_dir not found, using embedded assets" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Embedded assets include a favicon and minimal CSS
- Content-Type headers are set correctly based on file extension
- Caching headers (ETag, Cache-Control) are set for static assets

**Dependencies:** FUNC-078

---

### FUNC-081: Kahi Hash Password Subcommand

**Description:** Generate bcrypt password hashes for use in config files.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** `kahi hash-password` is run
  **When** the user types a password at the prompt (not echoed)
  **Then** a bcrypt hash is printed to stdout

- **Given** `echo "mypassword" | kahi hash-password`
  **When** stdin is piped
  **Then** a bcrypt hash is printed to stdout

**Error Handling:**

| Error Condition | Expected Behavior | User-Facing Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Empty password | Error | "password cannot be empty" |

**Edge Cases:**

- Password prompt suppresses echo for security
- Output is just the hash string, suitable for copy-paste into config

**Dependencies:** INFRA-004

---

### FUNC-082: Process Output Ring Buffer

**Description:** Maintain a configurable in-memory ring buffer of each process's recent output for log tailing without file logging.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** default config (no file logging)
  **When** `kahi ctl tail web` is issued
  **Then** the last data from the ring buffer is returned

- **Given** `stdout_capture_maxbytes = "1MB"` (default)
  **When** a process writes to stdout
  **Then** the buffer holds the last 1MB of stdout per process

- **Given** the ring buffer is full
  **When** new output arrives
  **Then** the oldest data is evicted

**Error Handling:**

None specific.

**Edge Cases:**

- Ring buffer is per-process per-stream (stdout and stderr separate)
- When stdout_capture_maxbytes is set to 0, the ring buffer is disabled and log tailing returns empty results
- Bounds: minimum 0 (disabled), maximum 100MB
- Memory is freed when process config is removed
- Ring buffer feeds SSE streaming when no log file exists

**Dependencies:** FUNC-018

- [ ] Tests clean up all processes and sockets on completion
- [ ] `task test-integration` runs integration tests specifically

**Dependencies:** TEST-001, FUNC-024

---

### TEST-003: End-to-End Test Infrastructure

**Description:** E2E tests that exercise the full system by building the real `kahi` binary, starting it as a subprocess, and communicating via `ctl.NewUnixClient`. All tests use `//go:build e2e` tags and run via `task test-e2e`.

**Architecture:** True black-box testing. `TestMain` builds the binary to a temp directory. Each test creates an isolated temp directory for socket + config, polls for readiness (socket existence -> health endpoint -> process state), and cleans up via shutdown then kill-if-needed.

**Timeouts and Polling:**

- Readiness polling stages: socket existence (5s, 100ms interval), health endpoint (3s, 50ms interval), process state (5s, 50ms interval)
- Cumulative readiness polling shall not exceed 30s before test failure
- Each E2E test sets a `context.WithTimeout` of 60s covering startup, execution, and cleanup
- `TestMain` sets a suite-wide timeout of 10 minutes as fallback
- `waitForState` polls at 50ms intervals; on timeout calls `t.Fatal()` with: "timeout waiting for process {name} to reach {state}; last state was {observed}"

**Cleanup Escalation:**

- Test cleanup sends shutdown command with 5s timeout
- If daemon process is still alive after 5s, send SIGKILL with 2s timeout
- If SIGKILL timeout expires, log warning and continue (do not block other test cleanup)
- Socket file and temp directory are always cleaned up via `t.Cleanup`

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] E2E tests start a real Kahi daemon, configure real programs (e.g., `sleep`, `echo`)
- [ ] Tests verify process start, stop, restart, autorestart, and shutdown behavior
- [ ] Tests verify API endpoints return correct status
- [ ] Tests verify CLI commands produce expected output
- [ ] E2E tests run in isolated temp directories
- [ ] `task test-e2e` runs end-to-end tests specifically
- [ ] E2E tests have a timeout to prevent hanging on failures

**Dependencies:** TEST-002

### TEST-004: Test Output Formatting with gotestsum

**Description:** Replace raw `go test -v` output with `gotestsum` for both local development and CI. Provides live progress counters (e.g., `12/68 PASS TestProcess_Start`), human-readable formatting, and JUnit XML output for GitHub Actions test summaries.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] `gotestsum` is added to the setup task in Taskfile.yml
- [ ] `task test-e2e` uses `gotestsum` with `--format testdox` for readable output
- [ ] `task test` uses `gotestsum` with `--format testdox` for unit tests
- [ ] `task test-integration` uses `gotestsum` with `--format testdox` for integration tests
- [ ] `task coverage` uses `gotestsum` with `--format testdox` and `--junitfile` for coverage runs
- [ ] CI integration workflow produces JUnit XML via `--junitfile results.xml`
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow uses `dorny/test-reporter` action to display results in PR checks
- [ ] Local `task test` and `task test-e2e` show live progress (test name + pass/fail as each completes)
- [ ] Failing tests show full output inline (not suppressed by formatting)

**Error Handling:**

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `gotestsum` not installed | `task setup` installs it; CI installs it in setup step |
| JUnit XML write fails | CI step logs warning but does not fail the build |
| Test reporter action fails | Non-blocking; test pass/fail still determined by gotestsum exit code |

**Dependencies:** TEST-003

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Daemon startup time (cold start, no processes): < 100ms
- Process start latency (time from API request received to child process begins execution, post-fork before exec): < 50ms
- API response time for status query (100 processes): < 10ms
- Memory overhead per managed process: < 1MB
- SSE streaming latency (log line to client): < 100ms
- Config reload time (100 program definitions): < 500ms

**Measurement methodology:** All latency thresholds are 99th percentile, measured on an idle system. Performance tests run 100 iterations, report mean/median/p99. Test fails if p99 exceeds threshold, reporting measured values.

### Security

- No shell execution for child processes (direct exec only)
- Bcrypt for password hashing (cost factor >= 10)
- Unix socket default with restrictive permissions (0700)
- TCP server requires authentication
- FIPS 140 compliant cryptography via GOFIPS140=v1.0.0
- Health/readiness endpoints exempt from auth (standard probe practice)
- Webhook secrets in env vars, not plaintext in config

### Platform Support

- Linux: amd64, arm64 (kernel 4.18+)
- macOS: amd64, arm64 (12.0+)
- Go: 1.26.0+
- Static binary, no shared library dependencies
